## 1. Portfolio Structure and Notation

**Asset Universe**

  
$$
S = \{s_1, s_2, \dots, s_N\}
$$
  

This represents the set of assets under consideration, including stocks, bonds, and alternative investments.

**Weight Vector**

  
$$
W = 
\begin{bmatrix}
w_1 \\
w_2 \\
\vdots \\
w_N
\end{bmatrix}, \quad \sum_{i=1}^N w_i = 1,\quad w_i \ge 0
$$
  

Each $w_i$ indicates the fraction of capital allocated to asset $s_i$.  
The weights must sum to 1, assuming full investment.  
Short-selling is not allowed under these constraints.

**Portfolio Return**

  
$$
R = 
\begin{bmatrix}
R_1 \\
R_2 \\
\vdots \\
R_N
\end{bmatrix}, \quad
R_p = W^T R = \sum_{i=1}^N w_i R_i
$$
  

The total portfolio return is the weighted average of the individual asset returns.

## 2. Expected Return and Variance

**Expected Return**

  
$$
\mathbb{E}[R_p] = \sum_{i=1}^N w_i \mu_i = W^T \mu
$$
  

Here, $ \mu_i = \mathbb{E}[R_i] $ is the expected return of asset $s_i$, and $ \mu $ is the vector of expected returns across all assets.

**Portfolio Variance**

  
$$
\text{Var}(R_p) = W^T \Sigma W = \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^N w_i w_j \sigma_{ij}
$$
  

$ \Sigma $ is the covariance matrix of asset returns.  
The variance of the portfolio accounts for both the individual risks and the correlations between assets.

## 3. Mean-Variance Utility and Optimization

A risk-averse investor seeks to achieve the highest possible return for a given level of risk.  
This trade-off can be modeled using the mean-variance utility function:

  
$$
U(W) = \mathbb{E}[R_p] - \frac{A}{2} \text{Var}(R_p) = W^T \mu - \frac{A}{2} W^T \Sigma W
$$
  

The parameter $A > 0$ captures the investor’s risk aversion.  
A higher value of $A$ reflects greater sensitivity to risk.

**Optimization Problem**

  
$$
\begin{aligned}
\max_W \quad & W^T \mu - \frac{A}{2} W^T \Sigma W \\
\text{s.t.} \quad & \mathbf{1}^T W = 1, \quad W \succeq 0
\end{aligned}
$$
  

This problem identifies the weight vector $W$ that maximizes the investor's utility  
while satisfying the constraints of full investment and no short-selling.

By solving the optimization problem for various values of the risk aversion parameter $A$,  
we can generate a set of optimal portfolios.  
These portfolios collectively form the **Efficient Frontier**,  
which represents the highest expected return achievable at each level of risk.

Each point on the frontier corresponds to a portfolio that is not dominated in terms of risk and return.  
In other words, no other portfolio offers a higher return for the same level of risk.

When a risk-free asset with return $R_f$ becomes available, investors can construct new portfolios by combining the risk-free asset with a portfolio on the efficient frontier.  
The resulting combinations lie along a straight line known as the **Capital Market Line (CML)**:
  
$$
\mu_p = R_f + \sigma_p \cdot \frac{\mu_M - R_f}{\sigma_M}
$$
  

The slope of this line, given by $ \frac{\mu_M - R_f}{\sigma_M} $, is known as the **Sharpe Ratio**, which indicates the excess return earned per unit of risk.
